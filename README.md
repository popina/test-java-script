# test-web

Integrate the screens below as best as you can.

- Request the data from the route : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/popina/test-web/master/data.json
- Parse the response
- Add a loader and error handling in case the network is slow or api is down.
- You can use Axios, Http ... or any other framwork you might find useful and helpful.
- Structure with a MVC pattern

## Rules to follow
- Code in Javascript or Php
- You must commit regularly so we can follow your progress with an initial empty commit when you start the test
- if you code in javascript please don't use any framework and code in ES6
- if you code in javascript don't use Ajax or Jquery, use only pure Javascript

## Deliverables

- the link to the git repository
- several commits, with an explicit message each time
- a separate file or email documenting your process and principles you've followed
